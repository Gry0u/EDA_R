# Exploratory Data Analysis in R
This tidy [data set](./wineQualityReds.csv) contains 1,599 red wines with 11 variables describing chemical wine properties. At least 3 wine experts rated the quality of each wine, providing a rating between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent).   
In all my study, my dependent variable will be the wine quality. All the other wine properties are considered independent variables analysed to try to predict wine quality.
